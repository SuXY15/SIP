## Spherically Inward Propagating Flame of Type Ia Supernova

Supernova represent the catastrophic explosions that mark the end of the life of some stars. The ejected mass is of order 1 to 10 solar masses with bulk velocities ranging from a few thousand to a few tens of thousands of km/s.[^1] The traditional single Chandrasekhar mass C–O White Dwarf burning is still considered to be responsible for a large population of type Ia supernova (SN Ia). Specifically, one of the key issues in its modeling is related to the flame acceleration and deflagration-detonation transition (DDT), with flame front instabilities being considered as a possible mechanism in driving the acceleration. The perspective of this proposal is to give a set of solutions of this problem. The milestones of this project are planed to be:

​	(a) Complete a set of code that can solve the 1D $H_2$-$O_2$ flame.

​	(b) Complete a set of code that can solve the simplest reacting flow in SN Ia conditions.

​	(c) Try to observe spherical flame acceleration with large Lewis number curvature effect.

​	(d) Try to observe pulsation in Xing & Zhao's case.

​	(e) Try to observe deflagration-detonation transition (DDT) in (d).
